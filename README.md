# LexicalAnalyzer

# Language implementation system will input a file, identify substrings, and find all syntax errors. For an input program a lexical analyzer will break a file into # tokens. The parser will find all syntax errors. For each error the parser will produce an appropriate diagnostic message, and recover quickly.
